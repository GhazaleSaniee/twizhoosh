{"name":"@Twizhoosh","tagline":"Smart Persian Twitter-bot","body":"# Twizhoosh\r\n\r\n[@Twizhoosh](https://twitter.com/twizhoosh) is a smart Persian twitter-bot, written in Python and aimed to be easily\r\nreadable and contributable.\r\n \r\n## Know Him Better\r\n- Twizhoosh does not talk too much and will not bother people who follow him.\r\n- He does not reply to a tweet more than once.\r\n- He never replies to people he is not following.\r\n- He does not have any long term memory.\r\n- He would not be rude to anyone, unless it is necessary.\r\n- He is smart.\r\n \r\n## How to Contribute\r\n \r\nAre you willing to contribute to Twizhoosh? Great. If you only need to edit a file (e.g. adding a spelling\r\ncorrection entry) you may just browse the file on Github and click on the edit icon. Github will do the rest\r\nfor you. But if you are trying to implement a script for Twizhoosh you should:\r\n\r\n1. Fork Twizhoosh.\r\n2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-script`\r\n3. Implement your feature.\r\n4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some script'`\r\n5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-script`\r\n6. Submit a pull request.\r\n \r\n## Implementing a Script\r\n\r\nThere are three types of scripts:\r\n\r\n1. Timeline scripts: Called on any timeline update.\r\n2. On demand scripts: Called when twizhoosh is demanded.\r\n3. Stand-alone scripts: Called repeatedly (not implemented yet).\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at current scripts in `scripts` folder. Do not forget to add your scripts to `settings.py` after\r\nimplementing.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, test your feature. You can do it by running `test.py` and simulating the timeline.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nYou need `Python 3.4` or later and `twython 3.2` to run the code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
